1. remove the 5 of clubs or 5 of clover with the 6 of clover

2.the amount of cards remaining on the board without there being a full J, Q, and K set must always be an even number as you always remove 2 cards at a time.

3. None of the pairs of cards that add to eleven overlap therefore it is  luck based on which cards are drawn every time meaning this game has no strategy.
